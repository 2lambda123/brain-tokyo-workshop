# Neuroevolution of Self-Interpretable Agents (Simplified)

![attentionagent](https://storage.googleapis.com/quickdraw-models/sketchRNN/attention/assets/card/attentionagent.gif)  
Our agent receives visual input as a stream of 96x96px RGB images (left). Each image frame is passed through a self-attention bottleneck module, responsible for selecting K=10 patches (highlighted in white, middle). Features from these K patches (such as location) are then routed to a decision-making controller (right) that will produce the agentâ€™s next action. The parameters of the self-attention module and the controller are trained together using neuroevolution.

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results presented in the orignal [paper](https://attentionagent.github.io/). 

## Evaluate pre-trained models

You can run the following commands to evaluate the trained agent.
```
# Evaluate for 100 episodes.
python eval_agent.py --log-dir=pretrained/carracing --n-episodes=100

# Evaluate CarRacing with GUI.
python eval_agent.py --log-dir=pretrained/carracing --render

# Evaluate CartPole with GUI.
python eval_agent.py --log-dir=pretrained/cartpole --render
```

## Training

To train on a local machine, run the following command:
```
# Train CarRacing locally.
python train_agent.py --config=configs/carracing.gin --log-dir=log/carracing --reps=3

# Train CartPole locally on GPUs.
python train_agent.py --config=configs/cartpole.gin --log-dir=log/cartpole --num-gpus=8
```
Please see `train_agent.py` for other command line options.
